Lacan's discourse is essentially a theory of desire, where the individual subject is animated entirely by desire. More precisely, the subject itself is an structural emergent of desire, which is generated by the symbolic gap between need (biological drive) and demand (speech), which generates desire (the ineliminable remainder) and, with it, the subject.

A new born baby when he land out of the womb has no self-consciousness about his surrounding but merely only immediate, automatic physiological responsiveness to his surrounding. It is considered a living human being, say, the moment he survived outside of the womb; however, for lacanian pyschoanalysis, that identification of organism does not naturally induced the existence of a new subject - the baby not yet enters a world of symbols, and acquires linguistic rules to to express that identity. The subject is a subject S, only by virtue of his subjection to the field of the others.

The process of self-identification conceptually occurs at mirror stage, the process in which he projected his somatic experience into an imaginary body-image. Consider this case: when the baby for the first time stares at himself in the mirror, he starts to falsely identify himself as the person in that mirror, which was only a projection of himself. This mapping from self to self-identification - the 3-dimentional entity (self), squeezed into a 2-dimentional imagine -

However, this procedure is never accomplished faithfully, but induced a distortion, or alienation of the real self inside a space of imaginary register. In Lacan’s own terms, this Imaginary register is “a drama…which manufactures for the subject…the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality”. This is to say, computationally, we need to create an “ideal-I” subspace whose attractor structure induces jubilation—and whose inherent distortion enforces alienation—mirrors how the infant’s ego both consolidates and betrays itself.
