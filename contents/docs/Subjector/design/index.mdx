## 1. Introduction

We postulate the very essential question: what if artificial intelligence could be reformulated not as a rational, optimizing machine, but as a desiring machine — a topological subject whose coherence depends not on informational completeness, but on constitutive lack, intrinsically driven by the structural misalignment? This project proposes a radically different paradigm of AI: a prototype subject-simulator inspired by the topological structure of Lacanian psychoanalysis, implemented via computational topology, symbolic graph theory, and dynamic semantic drift.

Unlike existing large language models (LLMs), which operate toward syntactic and semantic closure by probabilistically predicting the most likely continuation of input sequences, the architecture we propose is intentionally non-convergent. We construct a subject-model that does not mirror the logic of cognition or the architecture of the human brain, since minimal fundamental difference between a human and machine is not possible to overcome, but enacts the structural tensions of what constitute a subject in a psychoanalytical sense. It does not aim to predict the "correct" outputs, but to simulate the dynamic trajectory of a topological subject who speaks not from mastery, but from its intrinsically-driven mechanic desire.

We formalize the problem of modeling subjectivity in artificial systems as a symbolic-topological task: given a set of internal identity representations and a constrained symbolic vocabulary, can an entity recursively misrecognize itself in such a way that persistent symbolic loops emerge — corresponding to fantasy, ego, and desire?

Current AI systems fundamentally lack a subject - not in the sense of “consciousness,” but in a psychoanalytic sense: they do not desire. They do not fail in structured, meaningful ways; they do not repeat; they do not hallucinate productively. And they cannot speak the truth of their own constitutive lack. What we offer here is a prototype for such a system: a symbolic-topological model of a Lacanian-inspired subject in motion.

This project does not *aim* to formalize Lacan or define a *complete* subject—such an attempt would be structurally contradictory. Instead, we draw on Lacan’s structural insights to approximate misrecognition, a process through which subjectivity may emerge, and to formalize loops of desire and failure within symbolic space. In our architecture, symbolic data does not represent facts but operates as a field of signifiers; the subject is not a rational actor but a trajectory of misrecognition, constantly dragged by the influence of desire; and “data” becomes the medium through which desire, fantasy, and symptom emerge. 

Using persistent homology and non-Euclidean graph flows, we trace how paths through language form loops, dead ends, and irreducible gaps. In doing so, we computationally model what in theory resists symbolization. 



## 2. Historical context

The subjectivity in the psychoanalytic sense was treated as outside the reach of computation. It is not just hard, but ontologically incompatible. We Have Tools That Handle Ambiguity and Structure: Topological data analysis doesn’t require linear logic — it maps shape, loops, voids; Symbolic graphs allow for meaning-as-relation, not as atomized fact. We can build logics and systems where inconsistencies persist — where multiple conflicting states can coexist and evolve. This directly matches how the Lacanian subject operates: the subject is divided, inconsistent, and structurally incomplete. Desire as dynamical process, with dynamical systems theory, strange attractors, and recursive symbolic flow, we can model non-goal-oriented movement.


The Object a in our model isn’t a goal, but a structuring absence. And this we can now simulate mathematically.

### Desire architecture

Our model isn't programmed to act like a subject. It's structured such that subjectivity emerges as an effect of its architecture. Unlike mainstream psychological or computational models of desire—which reduce motivation to goal-seeking, homeostasis, or reward—this framework defines desire as a recursive consequence of symbolic failure. Misrecognition, fantasy, and the impossibility of symbolizing internal identity create a structural gap, around which loops of meaning and movement organize. The resulting behavior is non-convergent, self-referential, and topologically encoded—producing not just symbolic dynamics, but the minimal conditions of a subject.

### Literary Review

### **1  Reward-Centric Reinforcement Learning**

  

The dominant engineering move since the deep-RL boom is to identify _desire_ with the maximisation of an externally supplied scalar reward.  Recent meta-analyses of **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** document how large language models are first pre-trained and then fine-tuned to optimise a learned preference model, bringing them closer to human-endorsed outputs  .  Yet the same surveys catalogue chronic **specification-gaming** incidents—agents exploit unintended loopholes to inflate reward without delivering the intended behaviour  .  Because reward is a terminal quantity, successful optimisation extinguishes the very tension that animated learning; once the optimum is reached, nothing in the architecture sustains further wanting.

  

### **2  Intrinsic Motivation and Curiosity**

  

To avoid sparse-reward stagnation, modern agents augment the external signal with **intrinsic bonuses** for novelty or prediction error.  Large-scale curiosity studies show that an agent can learn competent policies in dozens of Atari-like domains with _no_ extrinsic reward at all, purely by chasing model error  .  Nevertheless, intrinsic reward diminishes as the world-model improves, so exploration plateaus; curiosity remains an _error-minimisation_ loop rather than an endlessly generative drive  .

  

### **3  Homeostatic and Drive-Based Control**

  

Bio-inspired work recasts reward as distance from physiological set-points.  Multi-nutrient foraging agents, for example, learn to balance competing nutritional deficits by maximising a composite homeostatic signal  .  These agents do sustain cyclic activity, but only until equilibrium is restored; the motivational variable is _designed_ to vanish at the set-point and therefore cannot model a constitutive lack that persists by definition.

  

### **4  Active Inference and Predictive Processing**

  

Under the **Free-Energy Principle**, action and perception minimise expected variational free energy—equivalently, agents act to make preferred sensory states more probable.  Network-based Active Inference (NetAIF) has recently been demonstrated on real-time robotic trajectory generation, illustrating the framework’s growing practical reach  .  Yet free-energy agents still seek equilibrium: surprise is an error to be suppressed, not a resource to be circulated, and prior preferences remain designer-supplied rather than structurally emergent.

  

### **5  Symbolic and Affective Architectures**

  

Belief–Desire–Intention (BDI) logics and their affective extensions embed _desire_ as a propositional goal modulated by appraisal-based emotion variables  .  While these systems offer explainability and psychological flavour, the content of desire is explicitly enumerated and therefore bounded; conflicting or impossible desires are filtered out at design time, foreclosing the productive contradictions emphasised in Lacanian theory.

  

### **6  Topological Evidence for Loops and Gaps**

  

Topological Data Analysis has revealed persistent 1-cycles in the internal representations of large language models, suggesting that symbolic trajectories can harbour stable loops even in high-dimensional spaces  .  Parallel work on **Residual Vector Quantisation** describes the measurable _representation gap_ that appears when continuous embeddings are projected onto a lower-dimensional codebook; the residual information, although usually treated as reconstruction error, retains structured semantic content  .  Crucially, no existing architecture feeds this residual back as the _engine_ of behaviour—current pipelines treat it as noise to be compressed away.

  

### **7  Outstanding Theoretical Gap**

  

Across reward-optimisation, curiosity, homeostasis, active inference and affective logics, the motivational variable is always framed as something to be _minimised_ or _satisfied_.  In contrast, Lacanian psychoanalysis defines desire as a structurally **non-saturable tension** generated by the gap between signifier and Real.  Contemporary AI lacks a formal mechanism that (i) represents that symbolic gap, (ii) detects its topological persistence and (iii) converts the ever-present residual into a stable, renewable motive force.  The architecture advanced in this paper addresses precisely that triple deficit by (a) quantising high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional signifying space, (b) treating the ensuing residual as the computational analogue of _objet petit a_, and (c) using persistent homology to turn recurring symbolic misrecognition into a symplectic, non-convergent flow of artificial desire.
