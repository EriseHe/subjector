Since the early 2000s a small “neuropsychoanalysis” movement has tried to map Lacanian concepts onto brain systems.  One popular analogy likens Lacan’s lack to dopamine‐mediated reward anticipation: dopamine fires only in the expectation (i.e. lack) of reward, then shuts off on satisfaction. To suggest

a neurophysiological echo

out that these remain analogies: neither dopamine signals nor free‐energy minimization were defined to capture Lacanian lack, and there is no experiment in which blocking dopamine removes the structural feature of desire as Lacan meant it

Malcolm Bowie said "the subject's desire - or, more precisely, the subject qua deisre" since this desire is all that he is. When it comes to deisre in lacaninan context, subject emg

to turn Lacan’s insight (“subject as the immersion of desire”) into working AI architectures, we need to pin down three things: (1) what “desire” means algorithmically, (2) how a “lack-driven” dynamic can be encoded in a learning agent, and (3) why a subject-like agent will then emerge rather than being hard-coded
