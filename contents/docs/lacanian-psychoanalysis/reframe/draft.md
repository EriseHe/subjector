##### obscurity discourages readers

The obscurity cultivated in Lacan’s psychoanalysis has often been criticized.  As Malcolm Bowie famously observes, “[Lacan] … contrives to suggest that a supreme obviousness is at work beneath the busy textures of his writing.” One of his most controversial move was his deployment of topology, which was commonly regarded as cited without grounding their relevance with the human psyche.

Many commentators point out that his turn from structural linguistics to his penchant for algebraic “mathemes” often produce a theory too abstract to apply consistently in a clinical setting. Instead of a practical guidance, the introduction of topology was perhaps intended to raise his theory to the dignity of the mathematics through a monolithic pyscho-topology framework. However, all too often, his cited topological concepts feels more obstructive than illuminating. The density of Lacan’s construction make it nearly impossible to extract an empirically testable hypothesis. 

Lacan’s insistence on the “symbolic” order, for example, producing a primordial gap (the manque) relies on a highly theory‐laden language game, but offers no straightforward way to verify—through observation or measurement—where that gap “is,” or how it manifests concretely during analysis. In clinical practice, this can yield widely differing interpretations of *exactly* where—and why—lack is operative, which allows virtually any clinical observation to be retroactively fitted into Lacan’s schema. 

However, these methodological impasses can be weighted if we step outside the strict clinical context in which the theory originated, but re-conceive psychoanalysis not primarily as a clinical protocol but as a structural paradigm in which the subject is modeled analogously to a computational system. This way, it need not remain locked behind its hermetic mathemes. In other words, if Lacanian psychoanalysis can be rendered computationally tractable for system design—while preserving, or at least approximating, the original conceptual intent—then the question of “where and why” becomes an engineering decision, not a metaphysical one. 

If we _formalize_ the lacanian framework as a context-model, or a type architecture—whatever our **presupposed** "symbolic order" is—then it becomes tractable. We can measure whether our model respects consistency constraints, whether it “hallucinates” (i.e. violates its own symbolic laws), you can log and test invariants, such that the “mystical” air evaporates when we reduce it to code and unit tests.

This is by no means a immediately feasible task, but the often skeptical introduction of topology into his theory offers us a route to relocate the task. After more than half a century of continuous development in fields like topological data analysis (TDA), we may have reached a threshold where Lacan’s vision—assembling the _subject_ through the language of algebraic topology—is no longer purely metaphorical but potentially pragmatic. It may even be the only viable option if we ever seek to render his theory computationally accessible. Although Lacan’s original mathematization was certainly not intended for computation, the precision in standard topology could offer valuable insights for system‐level modeling of artificial subjectivity. Hence, the essential question becomes: **How can we make his challenging use of topology operationally viable?**

This repositioning is ambitious but no longer outlandish. Twenty years ago it would have been purely speculative; today there is peer-reviewed work that treats Lacanian orders as modules inside active-inference code, and robust TDA methods for auditing such models. Therefore, such method is _motivated_ by three converging facts: (i) formal FEP/Lacan mappings now exist; (ii) topology has proven computational dividends in neural data; (iii) ML pipelines can already optimise over topological constraints.

Since this project is not clinical but computational in orientation, these notes are compiled with philosophical humility. I strive for a lucid, straightforward presentation of Lacanian psychoanalysis, despite risking that some simplification of his theory is inevitable - but acceptable for computational design. This series of notes is dedicated to revisiting Lacanian psychoanalytic topology, drawing primarily on his late seminars and Will Greenshields’s _Writing the Structure of the Subject_. My aims are twofold: to introduce basic Lacanian ideas to those unfamiliar with his psychoanalysis, and to collect his foundational attempts to fuse topology with psychoanalytic theory “more than a metaphor.” In doing so, I hope to lay the groundwork for a proper topological framework that can serve computational purposes.

Therefore, this collection serves as a **prerequisite** for transforming Lacan’s _structure of the subject_ into an essentially—if not fully—computable topological model.

### Notes about Computational Formalism

 Heideggerian critiques (e.g., Coimbra et al., 2023) warn that computational formalisms tend to flatten the “voids” or “gaps” Lacan saw as constitutive of subjectivity, because standard digital devices cannot naturally instantiate the kind of “virtual void” that Lacan’s topology presumes [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41282-023-00407-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03857-x?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
