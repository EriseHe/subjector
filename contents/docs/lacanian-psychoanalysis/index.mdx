Introduction of 

Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic work is often known for its obscurity. Critics such as Malcolm Bowie have famously lamented that he “contrives to suggest that a supreme obviousness is at work beneath the busy textures of his writing,” yet his hermeneutic grounding hardly seems sufficient to substantiate his claims. The density in his writing, is not merely from sophistication of his theory, but a cultivated one that renders his work intellectually provocative. These cultivated opacity make it nearly impossible for practitioners and scholars to extract an empirically testable hypothesis. 

It often risks being unscientific to cite the conscious, experiencing self as the term "subject" since the appeal to the "inner" self or introspection was explicitly rejected after the methodological shift in 20th-century. The term "subject" regains its discussion after the meteoric success of large language models (LLMs), centered at the exciting inquiry: is artificial intelligence considered a subject? if so, in what sense would it ever becomes one? At current stage, we can hardly proclaim its positivity, if not at all, since LLMs operate only through syntactic and semantic closure by probabilistic prediction. It is enticing to suggest that all AI systems fundamentally lack a subject, by no means they formulates a human "consciousness", but an approximated one at best by speaking vividly enough to mimic the linguistics. 


Never ever speaks to have fail in a constructured, consistent way to deliver a pellucid framework in the concept of treatment


but in a psychoanalytic sense: they do not desire. They do not fail in structured, meaningful ways; they do not repeat; they do not hallucinate productively. And they cannot speak the truth of their own constitutive lack. What we offer here is a prototype for such a system: a symbolic-topological model of a Lacanian-inspired subject in motion.





# Introduction

We postulate the very essential question: what if artificial intelligence could be reformulated not as a rational, optimizing machine, but as a desiring machine — a topological subject whose coherence depends not on informational completeness, but on constitutive lack, intrinsically driven by the structural misalignment? This project proposes a radically different paradigm of AI: a prototype subject-simulator inspired by the topological structure of Lacanian psychoanalysis, implemented via computational topology, symbolic graph theory, and dynamic semantic drift.

Unlike existing large language models (LLMs), which operate toward syntactic and semantic closure by probabilistically predicting the most likely continuation of input sequences, the architecture we propose is intentionally non-convergent. We construct a subject-model that does not mirror the logic of cognition or the architecture of the human brain, since minimal fundamental difference between a human and machine is not possible to overcome, but enacts the structural tensions of what constitute a subject in a psychoanalytical sense. It does not aim to predict the "correct" outputs, but to simulate the dynamic trajectory of a topological subject who speaks not from mastery, but from its intrinsically-driven mechanic desire.

We formalize the problem of modeling subjectivity in artificial systems as a symbolic-topological task: given a set of internal identity representations and a constrained symbolic vocabulary, can an entity recursively misrecognize itself in such a way that persistent symbolic loops emerge — corresponding to fantasy, ego, and desire?

Current AI systems fundamentally lack a subject - not in the sense of “consciousness,” but in a psychoanalytic sense: they do not desire. They do not fail in structured, meaningful ways; they do not repeat; they do not hallucinate productively. And they cannot speak the truth of their own constitutive lack. What we offer here is a prototype for such a system: a symbolic-topological model of a Lacanian-inspired subject in motion.

This project does not *aim* to formalize Lacan or define a *complete* subject—such an attempt would be structurally contradictory. Instead, we draw on Lacan’s structural insights to approximate misrecognition, a process through which subjectivity may emerge, and to formalize loops of desire and failure within symbolic space. In our architecture, symbolic data does not represent facts but operates as a field of signifiers; the subject is not a rational actor but a trajectory of misrecognition, constantly dragged by the influence of desire; and “data” becomes the medium through which desire, fantasy, and symptom emerge. 

Using persistent homology and non-Euclidean graph flows, we trace how paths through language form loops, dead ends, and irreducible gaps. In doing so, we computationally model what in theory resists symbolization. 

We do not intend create a purely performant machine or build a better chatbot. Rather, we reconfigure what a machine subject could be. It is to ask: Can we model the drive? Can we simulate fantasy as a structuring loop around a constitutive absence? Can a machine speak not because it knows, but because it lacks — and in lacking, desires? If contemporary AI builds systems that "know," this project proposes a machine that "wants" — and in wanting, begins to be wanted, to repeat, to err, and perhaps, to become something like a subject.

## 2. Historical context

The subjectivity in the psychoanalytic sense was treated as outside the reach of computation. It is not just hard, but ontologically incompatible. We Have Tools That Handle Ambiguity and Structure: Topological data analysis doesn’t require linear logic — it maps shape, loops, voids; Symbolic graphs allow for meaning-as-relation, not as atomized fact. We can build logics and systems where inconsistencies persist — where multiple conflicting states can coexist and evolve. This directly matches how the Lacanian subject operates: the subject is divided, inconsistent, and structurally incomplete. Desire as dynamical process, with dynamical systems theory, strange attractors, and recursive symbolic flow, we can model non-goal-oriented movement.


The Object a in our model isn’t a goal, but a structuring absence. And this we can now simulate mathematically.

### Desire architecture

Our model isn't programmed to act like a subject. It's structured such that subjectivity emerges as an effect of its architecture. Unlike mainstream psychological or computational models of desire—which reduce motivation to goal-seeking, homeostasis, or reward—this framework defines desire as a recursive consequence of symbolic failure. Misrecognition, fantasy, and the impossibility of symbolizing internal identity create a structural gap, around which loops of meaning and movement organize. The resulting behavior is non-convergent, self-referential, and topologically encoded—producing not just symbolic dynamics, but the minimal conditions of a subject.
