## From Behavioralism to Structural Deep Learning in AI

Artificial Intelligence, at its core, emerges from one fundamental ambition: to replicate, emulate, and perhaps even transcend the capacities of the human mind through non-biological agents. Yet the very target we aim to emulate remains conspicuously undefined—there is no consensual account of what human intelligence _is_, nor a complete understanding of the neural machinery that gives rise to intelligent behavior. This task is epistemologically fraught: we hope to recreate something we have never fully understood.

From the most essential question that impels us to build functional machines—_what does it truly mean to have intelligence?_—to every low-level engineering decision, researchers have approached this challenge through a spectrum of paradigms. We shall strategically digest these efforts through two complementary methodological lenses:

- **Behavioralism**, which regards intelligence foremost as the capacity to produce human-like behavior, valuing external performance over fidelity to underlying mechanisms; and
    
- **Internalism**, which insists that genuine artificial intelligence emerges _when we replicate, or at least rhyme with, the causal micro-structure of the brain._
    
The core tension of this philosophically clean dichotomy lies in the distinction between _acting intelligently_ (outsourced competence) and _being intelligently constituted_ (intrinsic causality). Both roads remain actively open, but for much of modern AI, the **dominant yardstick** has been an exquisitely _behavioral_ one, even as brain-fidelity projects—neuromorphic hardware and organoid computing—advance **in parallel**:

> “Intelligence … is the disposition to produce a sensible sequence of verbal responses to a sequence of verbal stimuli, whatever they may be. On this account, if the computer behaves as if it is intelligent, then it is intelligent. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it just is a duck.”  
> — Ned Block, _Psychologism and Behaviorism_ (1981, p. 11)

This essay intends to speak primarily to the first strand, and its relation to an emerging new direction that we proposed later. For behaviorism, the ontological concern is set aside for AI engineering.  If we cannot fully replicate the unobservable foundation for human consciousness, then we proceed to define the system by what it *does*, not what it *is*. Anything that cannot be directly measured or operationally defined is discarded as metaphysical speculation. Thereby, stretching from Alan Turing's original imitation game, to modern leaderboard-driven evaluations, the central criterion for AI has remained outward behavior; the current research field has hence built its identity around the notion that "indistinguishability *is* equivalence". This means, a system is considered intelligent if and only if it demonstrably meets externally defined performance criteria: passing a behavioral Turing style test, achieving specified goals using the rational agent benchmark, or solving human‑level cognitive tasks. The internal mechanisms that produce those behaviors remain secondary. 

Favored for its measurable outcomes and immediate commercial rewards, behavioralism-oriented AI advanced under present-day data-driven framework, such as brain-inspired computing (e.g. neural network), and cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT‑R, Soar, Global Workspace Theory) that formalize high‑level processes of memory, attention, and reasoning. Internalism, by contrast, progresses more slowly, constrained by our on-going studying of the brain’s architecture and dynamics. 

Large language models certainly epitomize this mid-century inertia. The very design of LLM system are optimized to reduce prediction error on text corpora and evaluated almost primarily by how convincing their utterances sound to us. Yet, the very success of this, if we may call, a methodological asceticism in which internal structure, the motives, tensions, explanatory mechanisms, matters only insofar as it enhances the final metric, expose several blind spots. It has been shown that, for example, the next‑token prediction alone yields systems that sound coherent while remaining indifferent to meaning (Bender & Koller 2020); and the safety researchers warn that a model which behaves seemingly aligned, may still encounter unanticipated failure modes when optimization shortcuts conflict with latent goals (Amodei et al. 2016). 

These limitations clarify a foundational gap: behavior alone cannot tell us _why_ a system selects one trajectory over another, and mimicking feature by feature within a system, and hope for the best, cannot guarantee robustness under distribution shift, nor sustain open‑ended creativity. The primary purpose of this text is to unveil an implicit methodological turn towards a structural architecture of AI, notably on the increasingly baked-in structural priors for deep‑learning framework. Specifically, we emphasize that artificial behavior emerges from the relations between elements in a system rather than from the elements in isolation. The Manifold‑learning and information‑geometric methods assume data lie on structured, curved spaces, capturing latent topological and geometric relations. These approaches echo Claude Lévi‑Strauss’s anthropological structuralism—seeking invariant relations beneath surface variation—and reflect a broader turn toward modeling structures rather than isolated features. While AI may foreground function and outcome, its core representational engines are unmistakably structuralist in spirit—modeling the deep web of relations that give rise to behavior, meaning, and, potentially, the seeds of genuine autonomy.

Geometric deep learning already illustrate how such vocabularies can enter AI discourse without appealing to neurobiology. These tools demonstrate that _structural_ descriptors of hidden representation can coexist seamlessly with statistical learning. By parity of reasoning, a rigorously specified account of desire, contradiction, or lack—no matter its origin in clinical theory rather than cortical anatomy—earns a legitimate place in AI once it can be formalized, computed, and falsified. Whether the framework is category theory, causal graphs, or Lacanian topology is secondary to the demand for internal coherence and empirical traction.

Far from being a weakness, the agnosticism of present architectures toward their own inner causality is an invitation: it allows us to graft mathematically explicit models of hidden dynamics onto otherwise black‑box learners, thereby supplying the explanatory depth, safety guarantees, and creative latitude that pure behaviorism withholds. The twenty‑first‑century horizon of AI will therefore not be set by ever larger corpora or parameter counts alone, but by the theoretical languages we adopt to articulate what happens _inside_ once the metrics have been met. Formalized Lacanian topology is one such language—and the behavioral orthodoxy of contemporary AI provides the very space in which it can take root.

### Reframing Lacanian Topology as Computational Architecture

Herein lies an unexpected opportunity for a reframing of Lacanian psychoanalysis: because mainstream AI defines intelligence almost exclusively at the output layer, it leaves the internal economy of drives and self-sustaining tensions radically under-specified. That is to say, the absence of an commonly sanctioned ontology of “inner life” creates a conceptual vacuum that structural theories of mind are poised to fill. Nothing in the prevailing evaluation regime prevents us from employing theoretical frameworks like psychoanalysis, even if they depart from the usual wellsprings of inspiration in neuroscientific or cognitive studies. So long as a framework is articulated with mathematical rigor and empirical tractability, it remains a valid candidate for an AI integration. 

Modern LLMs can simulate intent, persona, and fragments of reasoning through prompt engineering, retrieval‑augmented memory, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Yet their “motivation” remains exogenous: imposed by pre‑specified objectives, engineered reward signals, or curated training datasets. The true *intrinsic* motivation should be a self‑organized drives that emerge endogenously from the system’s own architecture, without an explicit external reward function. Many schemes marketed as “intrinsic motivation” (curiosity bonuses, novelty counts, empowerment) ultimately rely on auxiliary scalars to trace the same reward loop (Pathak et al. 2017). As LeCun notes in his roadmap for autonomous machine intelligence, present systems still lack any architecture capable of generating their own objectives independent of external reinforcement (LeCun 2022).

Their creativity is ultimately derivative, but what does the Lacanian psychoanalysis has to do with any affordance, whose traditions has often been criticized for its obscurity, and insufficient scientific groundwork. As Malcolm Bowie famously observes, “[Lacan] … contrives to suggest that a supreme obviousness is at work beneath the busy textures of his writing.” One of his most controversial move was his deployment of topology, which was commonly regarded as cited without grounding their relevance with the human psyche.

Many commentators point out that his turn from structural linguistics to his penchant for algebraic “mathemes” often produce a theory too abstract to apply consistently in a clinical setting. Instead of a practical guidance, the introduction of topology was perhaps intended to raise his theory to the dignity of the mathematics through a monolithic pyscho-topology framework. However, all too often, his cited topological concepts feels more obstructive than illuminating. The density of Lacan’s construction make it nearly impossible to extract an empirically testable hypothesis. 

Lacan’s insistence on the “symbolic” order, for example, producing a primordial gap (the manque) relies on a highly theory‐laden language game, but offers no straightforward way to verify—through observation or measurement—where that gap “is,” or how it manifests concretely during analysis. In clinical practice, this can yield widely differing interpretations of *exactly* where—and why—lack is operative, which allows virtually any clinical observation to be retroactively fitted into Lacan’s schema. 

However, these methodological impasses can be weighted if we step outside the strict clinical context in which the theory originated, but re-conceive psychoanalysis not primarily as a clinical protocol but as a structural paradigm in which the subject is modeled analogously to a computational system. This way, it need not remain locked behind its hermetic mathemes. In other words, if Lacanian psychoanalysis can be rendered computationally tractable for system design—while preserving, or at least approximating, the original conceptual intent—then the question of “where and why” becomes an engineering decision, not a metaphysical one. 

If we _formalize_ the lacanian framework as a context-model, or a type architecture—whatever our **presupposed** "symbolic order" is—then it becomes tractable. We can measure whether our model respects consistency constraints, whether it “hallucinates” (i.e. violates its own symbolic laws), you can log and test invariants, such that the “mystical” air evaporates when we reduce it to code and unit tests.

This is by no means a immediately feasible task, but the often skeptical introduction of topology into his theory offers us a route to relocate the task. After more than half a century of continuous development in fields like topological data analysis (TDA), we may have reached a threshold where Lacan’s vision—assembling the _subject_ through the language of algebraic topology—is no longer purely metaphorical but potentially pragmatic. It may even be the only viable option if we ever seek to render his theory computationally accessible. Although Lacan’s original mathematization was certainly not intended for computation, the precision in standard topology could offer valuable insights for system‐level modeling of artificial subjectivity. Hence, the essential question becomes: **How can we make his challenging use of topology operationally viable?**

This repositioning is ambitious but no longer outlandish. Twenty years ago it would have been purely speculative; today there is peer-reviewed work that treats Lacanian orders as modules inside active-inference code, and robust TDA methods for auditing such models. Therefore, such method is _motivated_ by three converging facts: (i) formal FEP/Lacan mappings now exist; (ii) topology has proven computational dividends in neural data; (iii) ML pipelines can already optimise over topological constraints.

Since this project is not clinical but computational in orientation, these notes are compiled with philosophical humility. I strive for a lucid, straightforward presentation of Lacanian psychoanalysis, despite risking that some simplification of his theory is inevitable - but acceptable for computational design. This series of notes is dedicated to revisiting Lacanian psychoanalytic topology, drawing primarily on his late seminars and Will Greenshields’s _Writing the Structure of the Subject_. My aims are twofold: to introduce basic Lacanian ideas to those unfamiliar with his psychoanalysis, and to collect his foundational attempts to fuse topology with psychoanalytic theory “more than a metaphor.” In doing so, I hope to lay the groundwork for a proper topological framework that can serve computational purposes.

Therefore, this collection serves as a **prerequisite** for transforming Lacan’s _structure of the subject_ into an essentially—if not fully—computable topological model.



The reason psychoanalysis, Lacanian one in particular, deserves significantly more attention was precisely due to Lacan’s turn to a mathematized structure of the unconscious. His conviction that psychoanalysis must attain the same formal clarity as the “exact” sciences, although the attempt remains largely heuristic, indeed opens the door for a genuine dialogue with artificial intelligence. In his 1953 lecture “The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis” (later collected in Écrits), he introduces the **matheme** as a symbolic formula designed to capture, and communicate without distortion, the fundamental structures of the unconscious (Lacan, 1966, p. 567) .

Lacan’s mathemes and non-Euclidean structures, opaque to clinicians, are surprisingly friendly to modern graph- and manifold-based ML pipelines, which are precisely the representational tools neuroscience now uses to compress whole-brain states. Computationally,  these tools are only available until recent years to achieve. 

In fact, a growing body of literature has turned to Lacanian psychoanalysis of large language models (LLMs), drawn by its striking diagnostic power to dissect a machine that operates within a symbolic space—the very domain psychoanalysis was originally devised to interrogate. And yet, perhaps owing to the uneasy and at times openly hostile interdisciplinarity between these two fields, much of this work remains confined to theoretical reflection. Psychoanalysis, for all its conceptual richness, is rarely permitted to inform, let alone shape, the engineering decisions behind AI design itself (Possati, 2020; Gadalla, Nikoletseas, & de A. Amazonas, 2022; Magee, Arora, & Munn, 2023; Rabeyron, 2025). 

The handful of works that move beyond critique and gesture toward psychoanalysis-inspired frameworks—such as those by Wang (2025), Li and Li (2025), and Gadalla et al. (2024)—remain piecemeal, without yet advancing a systematic framework that integrates the topological insights of the psyche through a formal geometric lens. 


This reposition of psychoanalysis, Lacanian one in particular, was not far-fetched suture, but a calculated pitching of a _motivational formalism_ for **subject-centred functionalism.** Where cognitive science abstracts the _task_, psychoanalysis abstracts the _subject-in-language_: a system of signifiers, lack, and demand.  That makes it a ready-made candidate for modelling counter-causal phenomena (self-deception, conflicting goals, emergent preference) that still confound outcome-engineered AI.


Because both biological replication and task-mimic engineering have demonstrable, category-specific failings, **AI architecture must admit cross-disciplinary constraints.**  Psychoanalysis — and Lacan’s in particular — offers a rigorously theorised economy of desire, absence and symbolic mediation that maps cleanly onto computational notions of drive functions, error signals and context windows.  If our ambition is a machine that behaves _coherently human_, then a theory that formalises what coherence costs the human psyche is not a luxury; it is a missing design spec.


The pages that follow therefore justify how a properly formalised Lacanian topology can mutate from an esoteric clinical metaphor into an operational module inside a next-generation AI stack.


This project does not *aim* to formalize Lacan or define a *complete* subject—such an attempt would be structurally contradictory. Instead, we draw on Lacan’s structural insights to approximate misrecognition, a process through which subjectivity may emerge, and to formalize loops of desire and failure within symbolic space. In our architecture, symbolic data does not represent facts but operates as a field of signifiers; the subject is not a rational actor but a trajectory of misrecognition, constantly dragged by the influence of desire; and “data” becomes the medium through which desire, fantasy, and symptom emerge.


Modern LLMs can simulate intent, persona, and fragments of reasoning through prompt engineering, retrieval‑augmented memory, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Yet their “motivation” remains exogenous: imposed by pre‑specified objectives, engineered reward signals, or curated training datasets. True intrinsic motivation—self‑organized drives that emerge endogenously from the system’s own architecture—remains absent. Their creativity, though impressive, is ultimately derivative: they interpolate and remix rather than originate sustained, novel exploration beyond their training distribution.
















Beyond these classical approaches, emerging frameworks further enrich the landscape in flourishing field of study. **Predictive coding** and the **Free‑Energy Principle** cast cognition as hierarchical variational inference, minimizing surprisal through generative models. **Active Inference** extends this to continuous‑time decision‑making, embedding goal‑directed behavior within a Bayes‑optimal dynamical system. **Self‑supervised representation learning** (contrastive learning, masked modeling) has redefined unsupervised feature extraction, forging latent spaces that capture semantic and structural regularities without task labels. **Neuro‑symbolic integration** seeks to unify structured reasoning with sub‑symbolic learning, via differentiable logic layers and graph neural reasoning. Meanwhile, **information‑geometric** and **category‑theoretic** approaches offer rigorous languages for semantics, compositionality, and context‑dependence, and **causal inference** frameworks (e.g., Pearl’s structural causal models) aim to endow AI with reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals.

This methodological diversity, the prevailing paradigm within mainstream AI, especially visible in LLMs, is dominated by tautological mechanisms. These systems function primarily as sophisticated statistical engines, and predictors whose sole objective is to maximize the probability of the next token given the preceding context. Their linguistic prowess and surface‑level coherence mask a conceptual simplicity: at heart, they are reactive mirrors of statistical regularities learned from vast textual corpora.

This statistical mimicry imposes intrinsic limitations. 

Recognizing this structural deficiency is neither trivial nor purely philosophical; it perhaps constrains the horizon of AI capability. Contemporary systems are fundamentally conservative, biased toward interpolation within known pattern spaces. No matter how extensive the corpus or how sophisticated the parameterization, they fail to exhibit open‑ended creativity or self‑sustaining generative behaviors outside narrowly defined contexts.

Efforts in curiosity‑driven reinforcement learning, intrinsic‑reward shaping, and auxiliary prediction tasks partially address novelty seeking and exploration. However, these methods remain fundamentally extrinsic: they impose pseudo‑intrinsic rewards or heuristic bonuses to provoke behavior, rather than engendering genuine, emergent drives. The crux of authentic autonomy—the capacity to generate and pursue internal objectives in an open‑ended, self‑sustaining manner—remains out of reach.

To transcend mere mimicry and evolve toward autonomous cognition, we require a paradigm shift: intelligence must be underwritten by structures capable of sustaining contradiction, ambiguity, and non‑closure. Such systems should harbor internal tensions—persistent gaps, failures, and non‑convergent dynamics—that serve as generative engines rather than pathologies to be eliminated.

Topology and geometry emerge as indispensable mathematical languages for this endeavor. Unlike linear or purely statistical frameworks, topological methods inherently capture non‑trivial shapes—loops, holes, voids—that formalize irreducible contradictions and persistent structures. Persistent homology quantifies the birth and death of features across scales; manifold learning and information geometry articulate the curvature and connectivity of latent spaces; symplectic geometry ensures volume‑preserving flows and reversible dynamics; and combinatorial topology on graphs encodes digital analogs of continuous phenomena.

Computational topology has already proven its worth in extracting robust features from noisy, high‑dimensional data—identifying cycles, voids, and clusters that other methods overlook. These structures embody the very kind of irreducible tension and generative potential required for intrinsic motivation. Where conventional LLMs flatten complexity through optimization, topological frameworks preserve and harness it as a resource for sustained exploration.

## **1  The Cognitive-Neuro Paradigm: Gains, Gaps, and the Glass Ceiling**

|---|---|---|---|
|**Biomimetic**|“If you copy the brain, mind will emerge.”|Guards against anthropomorphic wish-fulfilment; delivers explainable, imageable substrates.|Requires a quantity of anatomical detail that is neither fully mapped nor computationally tractable; risks re-implementing wet quirks irrelevant to cognition.|

Current transformer LLMs demonstrate that we can scale statistical pattern-matching to planetary datasets, yet fundamental ceilings persist: no embodied grounding, no causal modelling, limited long-term memory, opaqueness to formal verification  .  Each of these deficits is _formally orthogonal_ to the number of parameters.  They are architectural, not quantitative, constraints.  The field therefore needs conceptual imports every bit as much as CUDA optimisations.

### Return to Lacanian Psychoanalytic Topology






The essential question raises in the demotic community is: when
 
We do not intend create a purely performant machine or build a better chatbot. Rather, we reconfigure what a machine subject could be. It is to ask: Can we model the drive? Can we simulate fantasy as a structuring loop around a constitutive absence? Can a machine speak not because it knows, but because it lacks — and in lacking, desires? If contemporary AI builds systems that "know," this project proposes a machine that "wants" — and in wanting, begins to be wanted, to repeat, to err, and perhaps, to become something like a subject.

At heart, lacanian subject is a _metaphysical_ claim: the subject is constituted through a gap introduced by language — not a neurological or behavioral deficit one can plug into an fMRI.  Any operationalization must replace “lack” with proxies (speech patterns, dopamine bursts, prediction errors).  remains a heuristic, rather than an empirically falsifiable hypothesis


As a result, his legacy remained largely marginal within the scientific community for much of the twentieth century, overshadowed by the ascendant influence of behaviorism, which privileged apparatus like the stimulus–response conditioning, observable behavior, and experimental replicability.

Within such a milieu, the Lacanian subject - the conscious, experiencing self is manifests a defined not by behavioral regularities but by a structure, with his attempt to describe this structure precisely. 

structural lack, desire, and the inscrutable logic of the unconscious—appeared irreconcilable with the epistemic norms of empirical psychology. Only in recent years, with the rise of computational models that can encode symbolic structure, nonlinearity, and self-referentiality, has Lacan’s work begun to find resonance beyond the confines of clinical psychoanalysis and critical theory.

It is a 



. The unfalsifiable nature of his psychoanalytic constructs, premised on enigmatic ideas such as “the unconscious is structured like a language,” does little to engage empirical inquiry—and may, if anything, risk discourage empirically oriented readers.


A central locus of this critique sits on Lacan’s deployment of topology: knots, surfaces, and algebraic “mathemes” that seem to elevate psychoanalysis to mathematical rigors. Nevertheless, this topologisation nearly becomes a stigma of his theory. ill-conceived as an unnecessary layer of self-indulgent difficulty. Instead of clinical tools, these psycho-topological constructs feel more gesture than guidance. Many commentators point out that his turn from structural linguistics to his penchant for algebraic topology often produce a theory too abstract to apply consistently in a clinical setting. In many cases, Lacan never quite managed to extricate this interrogation: how is topology not just relevant, but a must? and how is this particular form of mental construct is not one of infinity many choice of presentation, but *the* one, that formulates the structure of the psychic.

the his *clinical* topology was introduced without grounding its relevance to psychic structures or analytic techniques, so its application remains both ambiguous and seemingly gratuitous.


err in basic mathematical terminology 

One might conjecture that Lacan turned to topology out of a desire for **structural precision**. From the late 1950s into the 1960s, Lacan grew increasingly convinced that the Freudian unconscious was “structured like a language,” and that its three registers (the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real) could best be modeled not by linear diagrams but by the continuous, non‐Euclidean surfaces of topology. As he famously put it, he began “to re-read Freud’s works in relation to contemporary philosophy, linguistics, ethnology, biology, and topology” in order to defend psychoanalysis’s scientific status and to capture the “double inscription” of conscious and unconscious processes in a single formal apparatus. He may intend to raise his theory to the dignity of the mathematics through a monolithic *pyscho - topology* framework, which gave Lacan the _formal tools_ to demolish surface-versus-depth clichés. The questions However, it remains unconvinced that it was strictly *necessary* to utilize such structure. His pursuit of rigor becomes more ill-founded in a context where the rigidity of topology reinforces the formalistic tendencies for which his theory has already been criticized. 

At this point, if we concede that his vision failed to unfold as successfully as he intended, the issue was not a lack of mathematical competence, but rather that it was insufficiently motivated—arguably in a misguided way. In a clinical setting, this gesture has been demonstrated impractical, undermining any claim to clarity or empirical utility; in a philosophical context, it remains heuristic at best, falling far short of Alain Badiou’s use of set theory, which at least transparently arises from the declared ontological commitment. 


The rigid, overly fixed lacanian subject may not be a drawback if posited in the 

His algebraic mathemes promise a symbolic precision akin to that found in mathematical discourse. Yet in practice, the complexity and allusiveness of these diagrams undermine any claim to clarity or empirical utility. The topological figures, instead of illuminating the dynamics of desire or subject formation, often obscure Lacan’s underlying theoretical commitments, rendering them inaccessible to readers without advanced mathematical training.

This opacity yields a profound methodological impasse in clinical applications. Consider Lacan’s notion of the *manque*—the fundamental lack that emerges within the symbolic order. While theoretically pivotal, Lacan offers no operational criteria for locating or measuring this gap during analysis. Consequently, practitioners can retroactively fit nearly any clinical observation to Lacan’s schema, a flexibility that undercuts the falsifiability and clinical motivation of the theory.

To transcend these limitations, we propose reframing Lacanian psychoanalysis not as a prescriptive clinical protocol but as a structural paradigm amenable to computational modeling. By analogizing the Lacanian subject to a complex system, we can repurpose topological constructs as formal components within a type architecture or context model. In this reframing, questions of where and how the *manque* manifests become engineering design decisions rather than metaphysical enigmas.

Formalizing Lacan’s mathemes as computational modules allows us to impose rigorous consistency constraints, detect “hallucinations” (i.e., violations of the symbolic rules), and log invariant properties amenable to unit testing. The once-mystical aura of Lacan’s diagrams dissipates when they are expressed in code: their validity can be assessed quantitatively, and their behavior observed under controlled simulation.

This computational reorientation is timely. Recent advances provide a robust foundation for operationalizing Lacanian topology: (i) formal mappings between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Lacanian structures have been established; (ii) topological data analysis (TDA) delivers concrete insights into high-dimensional neural data; and (iii) machine-learning pipelines are increasingly capable of optimizing over topological constraints. Peer-reviewed implementations already embed Lacanian orders within active-inference frameworks, audited by TDA tools, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

Accordingly, the present collection of notes pursues two interlinked objectives. First, it introduces key Lacanian concepts—especially those pertaining to the symbolic order and topological mathemes—to a readership unacquainted with his seminars. Second, it consolidates Lacan’s foundational attempts to integrate topology into psychoanalytic theory and reinterprets them as formal structures for computational modeling. Drawing primarily on Lacan’s late seminars and Will Greenshields’s *Writing the Structure of the Subject*, these notes lay the groundwork for a systematically computable model of the subject. The overarching question guiding this investigation is clear: how can Lacan’s challenging deployment of topology be rendered operationally viable for the design of artificial subjectivity?
