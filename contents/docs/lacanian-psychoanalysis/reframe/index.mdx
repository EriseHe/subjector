## From Behavioralism to Structuralism AI

Artificial Intelligence, at its core, emerges from one fundamental ambition: to replicate, emulate, and perhaps even transcend the capacities of the human mind. From the most essential question that urges us to build functional human-like machines, "what does it truly mean to mimic cognition?", to every local engineering decision, researchers have approached this challenge through a spectrum of paradigms. The most notable ones are neuroscience‑inspired models, striving for biological fidelity, emulating spiking networks, and cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT‑R, Soar, Global Workspace Theory) that formalize high‑level processes of memory, attention, and reasoning. 

For more than several decades, the dominant ambition of artificial‑intelligence research has been an exquisitely *behavioral* one: 

> “Intelligence … is the disposition to produce a sensible sequence of verbal responses to a sequence of verbal stimuli, whatever they may be. On this account, if the computer behaves as if it is intelligent, then it is intelligent. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it just is a duck.”  
> — Ned Block, describing the behavioral conception of the Turing test (1981, p. 11)

The ontological concern is set aside for AI engineering.  If we cannot fully replicate the unobservable foundation for human consciousness, then we proceed to define the system by what it *does*, not what it *is*. Anything that cannot be directly measured or operationally defined is discarded as metaphysical speculation. Thereby, from Alan Turing's original imitation game, to modern leaderboard-driven evaluations, the central criterion for AI has remained outward behavior, and the current AI field has hence built its identity around the notion that "indistinguishability *is* equivalence". This means, a system is considered intelligent if and only if it demonstrably meets externally defined performance criteria: passing a behavioral Turing‑style test, achieving specified goals using the rational‑agent benchmark, or solving human‑level cognitive tasks. The internal mechanisms that produce those behaviors remain secondary.

Large language models certainly epitomize this century-old tradition. The very design of LLM system are optimized to reduce prediction error on text corpora and evaluated almost exclusively by how convincing their utterances sound to us. Yet, the very success of this, if we may call, a methodological asceticism in which internal structure, the motives, tensions, explanatory mechanisms, matters only insofar as it enhances the final metric, expose several blind spots. It has been shown that, for example, the next‑token prediction alone yields systems that sound coherent while remaining indifferent to meaning (Bender & Koller 2020); and the safety researchers warn that a model which behaves seemingly aligned, may still encounter unanticipated failure modes when optimization shortcuts conflict with latent goals (Amodei et al. 2016). Even schemes marketed as “intrinsic motivation” (curiosity bonuses, novelty counts, empowerment) ultimately rely on auxiliary scalars to trace the same reward loop (Pathak et al. 2017). As LeCun notes in his roadmap for autonomous machine intelligence, present systems still lack any architecture capable of generating their own objectives independent of external reinforcement (LeCun 2022).

These limitations clarify a foundational gap: behavior alone cannot tell us _why_ a system selects one trajectory over another, and mimicking feature by feature within a system, and hope for the best, cannot guarantee robustness under distribution shift, nor sustain open‑ended creativity. The primary purpose of this text is to unveil an implicit methodological turn towards a structuralism architecture of AI, notably on the increasingly bake in structural priors for deep‑learning framework. Specifically, to formally embrace what has been less popular in 21 century, “structuralism”, requires us to emphases that artificial behavior emerges from the relations between elements in a system rather than from the elements in isolation. The Manifold‑learning and information‑geometric methods assume data lie on structured, curved spaces, capturing latent topological and geometric relations. These approaches echo Claude Lévi‑Strauss’s anthropological structuralism—seeking invariant relations beneath surface variation—and reflect a broader turn toward modeling structures rather than isolated features. While AI may foreground function and outcome, its core representational engines are unmistakably structuralist in spirit—modeling the deep web of relations that give rise to behavior, meaning, and, potentially, the seeds of genuine autonomy.

Topology and geometry already illustrate how such vocabularies can enter AI discourse without appealing to neurobiology. These tools demonstrate that _structural_ descriptors of hidden representation can coexist seamlessly with statistical learning. By parity of reasoning, a rigorously specified account of desire, contradiction, or lack—no matter its origin in clinical theory rather than cortical anatomy—earns a legitimate place in AI once it can be formalized, computed, and falsified. Whether the framework is category theory, causal graphs, or Lacanian topology is secondary to the demand for internal coherence and empirical traction.

Far from being a weakness, the agnosticism of present architectures toward their own inner causality is an invitation: it allows us to graft mathematically explicit models of hidden dynamics onto otherwise black‑box learners, thereby supplying the explanatory depth, safety guarantees, and creative latitude that pure behaviorism withholds. The twenty‑first‑century horizon of AI will therefore not be set by ever larger corpora or parameter counts alone, but by the theoretical languages we adopt to articulate what happens _inside_ once the metrics have been met. Formalized Lacanian topology is one such language—and the behavioral orthodoxy of contemporary AI provides the very space in which it can take root.

### Reframing Lacanian Topology as Computational Architecture

And herein lies an unexpected opportunity for a reframing of psychoanalysis: because mainstream AI defines intelligence almost exclusively at the output layer, it leaves the internal economy of drives, and self‑sustaining tensions radically under‑specified. This is to say, nothing in the prevailing evaluation regime prevents us from employing marginal theoretical frameworks, even if they depart from the usual wellspring of inspiration in neuroscience and cognitive science. So long as a framework is articulated with mathematical rigor and empirical tractability, it remains a valid candidate for integration into AI research. On the contrary, the absence of an commonly sanctioned ontology of “inner life” creates a conceptual vacuum that structural theories of mind are poised to fill. 

Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic work is often known for its obscurity. Critics such as Malcolm Bowie have famously lamented that he “contrives to suggest that a supreme obviousness is at work beneath the busy textures of his writing,” yet his hermeneutic grounding hardly seems sufficient to substantiate his claims. The density in his writing, is not merely from sophistication of his theory, but a cultivated one that renders his work intellectually provocative. These cultivated opacity make it nearly impossible for practitioners and scholars to extract an empirically testable hypothesis. 

It often risks being unscientific to cite the conscious, experiencing self as the term "subject" since the appeal to the "inner" self or introspection was explicitly rejected after the methodological shift in 20th-century. The term "subject" regains its discussion after the meteoric success of large language models (LLMs), centered at the exciting inquiry: is artificial intelligence considered a subject? if so, in what sense would it ever becomes one? At current stage, we can hardly proclaim its positivity, if not at all, since LLMs operate only through syntactic and semantic closure by probabilistic prediction. It is enticing to suggest that all AI systems fundamentally lack a subject, by no means they formulates a human "consciousness", but an approximated one at best by speaking vividly enough to mimic the linguistics. 


Never ever speaks to have fail in a constructured, consistent way to deliver a pellucid framework in the concept of treatment


but in a psychoanalytic sense: they do not desire. They do not fail in structured, meaningful ways; they do not repeat; they do not hallucinate productively. And they cannot speak the truth of their own constitutive lack. What we offer here is a prototype for such a system: a symbolic-topological model of a Lacanian-inspired subject in motion.



the most likely continuation of input sequences.






This project does not *aim* to formalize Lacan or define a *complete* subject—such an attempt would be structurally contradictory. Instead, we draw on Lacan’s structural insights to approximate misrecognition, a process through which subjectivity may emerge, and to formalize loops of desire and failure within symbolic space. In our architecture, symbolic data does not represent facts but operates as a field of signifiers; the subject is not a rational actor but a trajectory of misrecognition, constantly dragged by the influence of desire; and “data” becomes the medium through which desire, fantasy, and symptom emerge.





















Beyond these classical approaches, emerging frameworks further enrich the landscape in flourishing field of study. **Predictive coding** and the **Free‑Energy Principle** cast cognition as hierarchical variational inference, minimizing surprisal through generative models. **Active Inference** extends this to continuous‑time decision‑making, embedding goal‑directed behavior within a Bayes‑optimal dynamical system. **Self‑supervised representation learning** (contrastive learning, masked modeling) has redefined unsupervised feature extraction, forging latent spaces that capture semantic and structural regularities without task labels. **Neuro‑symbolic integration** seeks to unify structured reasoning with sub‑symbolic learning, via differentiable logic layers and graph neural reasoning. Meanwhile, **information‑geometric** and **category‑theoretic** approaches offer rigorous languages for semantics, compositionality, and context‑dependence, and **causal inference** frameworks (e.g., Pearl’s structural causal models) aim to endow AI with reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals.

This methodological diversity, the prevailing paradigm within mainstream AI, especially visible in LLMs, is dominated by tautological mechanisms. These systems function primarily as sophisticated statistical engines, and predictors whose sole objective is to maximize the probability of the next token given the preceding context. Their linguistic prowess and surface‑level coherence mask a conceptual simplicity: at heart, they are reactive mirrors of statistical regularities learned from vast textual corpora.

This statistical mimicry imposes intrinsic limitations. Modern LLMs can simulate intent, persona, and fragments of reasoning through prompt engineering, retrieval‑augmented memory, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Yet their “motivation” remains exogenous: imposed by pre‑specified objectives, engineered reward signals, or curated training datasets. True intrinsic motivation—self‑organized drives that emerge endogenously from the system’s own architecture—remains absent. Their creativity, though impressive, is ultimately derivative: they interpolate and remix rather than originate sustained, novel exploration beyond their training distribution.

Recognizing this structural deficiency is neither trivial nor purely philosophical; it perhaps constrains the horizon of AI capability. Contemporary systems are fundamentally conservative, biased toward interpolation within known pattern spaces. No matter how extensive the corpus or how sophisticated the parameterization, they fail to exhibit open‑ended creativity or self‑sustaining generative behaviors outside narrowly defined contexts.

Efforts in curiosity‑driven reinforcement learning, intrinsic‑reward shaping, and auxiliary prediction tasks partially address novelty seeking and exploration. However, these methods remain fundamentally extrinsic: they impose pseudo‑intrinsic rewards or heuristic bonuses to provoke behavior, rather than engendering genuine, emergent drives. The crux of authentic autonomy—the capacity to generate and pursue internal objectives in an open‑ended, self‑sustaining manner—remains out of reach.

To transcend mere mimicry and evolve toward autonomous cognition, we require a paradigm shift: intelligence must be underwritten by structures capable of sustaining contradiction, ambiguity, and non‑closure. Such systems should harbor internal tensions—persistent gaps, failures, and non‑convergent dynamics—that serve as generative engines rather than pathologies to be eliminated.

Topology and geometry emerge as indispensable mathematical languages for this endeavor. Unlike linear or purely statistical frameworks, topological methods inherently capture non‑trivial shapes—loops, holes, voids—that formalize irreducible contradictions and persistent structures. Persistent homology quantifies the birth and death of features across scales; manifold learning and information geometry articulate the curvature and connectivity of latent spaces; symplectic geometry ensures volume‑preserving flows and reversible dynamics; and combinatorial topology on graphs encodes digital analogs of continuous phenomena.

Computational topology has already proven its worth in extracting robust features from noisy, high‑dimensional data—identifying cycles, voids, and clusters that other methods overlook. These structures embody the very kind of irreducible tension and generative potential required for intrinsic motivation. Where conventional LLMs flatten complexity through optimization, topological frameworks preserve and harness it as a resource for sustained exploration.

## **1  The Cognitive-Neuro Paradigm: Gains, Gaps, and the Glass Ceiling**

Large-scale connectomic projects and cortical simulations have yielded genuine dividends: millimetre-resolution atlases, fruit-fly and mouse-brain wiring diagrams, and whole-brain dynamical models that predict how stimulation ripples across networks  .  At the same time, deep neural networks — themselves loose abstractions of cortical hierarchies — now decode speech, fold proteins and defeat Go champions.

  

1. _Data sufficiency._  EU’s €1-billion Human-Brain Project finished in 2024 without a unifying model of cognition; its own post-mortem admits that even petascale simulation “did not close the explanatory gap”  .
    
2. _Scale fallacy._  Blue Brain’s retirement note concedes that accurately emulating merely one mouse brain cell-type taxonomy remains computationally prohibitive  .
    
3. _Functional opacity._  Biologically faithful models output terabytes of spike trains yet struggle to answer a school-child’s “why” question.  In short: high-fidelity substrate, low-fidelity semantics.
    

  

The lesson is brutal but clear: _biological verisimilitude alone has not bought us human-level cognition._

## **2  Two Grand Design Logics — and Why Neither is Sufficient Alone**

|**Design logic**|**Slogan**|**Strength**|**Structural Limit**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Biomimetic**|“If you copy the brain, mind will emerge.”|Guards against anthropomorphic wish-fulfilment; delivers explainable, imageable substrates.|Requires a quantity of anatomical detail that is neither fully mapped nor computationally tractable; risks re-implementing wet quirks irrelevant to cognition.|
|**Outcome-driven engineering**|“Fake the behaviour; who cares how it works?”|Fast progress, product-ready; LLMs prove usefulness without petaflop connectomes.|Produces stochastic savants: eloquent but ungrounded, brittle, and hallucination-prone  .|

Your dichotomy _does_ make sense, but it should be seen as a tension, not a fork in the road. The most interesting systems today — say, neuro-symbolic hybrids — already splice subsymbolic pattern-handlers with explicit rule engines  . The deeper point is methodological: **“fidelity to substrate”** and **“fidelity to function”** are orthogonal axes, not mutually exclusive camps.

## **3  Why “Just Make the Network Bigger” Is an Epistemic Dead End**

  

Current transformer LLMs demonstrate that we can scale statistical pattern-matching to planetary datasets, yet fundamental ceilings persist: no embodied grounding, no causal modelling, limited long-term memory, opaqueness to formal verification  .  Each of these deficits is _formally orthogonal_ to the number of parameters.  They are architectural, not quantitative, constraints.  The field therefore needs conceptual imports every bit as much as CUDA optimisations.

## **4  Opening the Circle: Why Psychoanalysis Deserves a Seat at the Design Table**

1. **Different blind spots, different affordances.**  Neuroscience excels at mechanistic _“how,”_ cognitive science at computational _“what,”_ but psychoanalysis specialises in the motivational _“why”_ — desire, drive, inhibition, repetition.
    
2. **Subject-centred functionalism.**  Where cognitive science abstracts the _task_, psychoanalysis abstracts the _subject-in-language_: a system of signifiers, lack, and demand.  That makes it a ready-made candidate for modelling counter-causal phenomena (self-deception, conflicting goals, emergent preference) that still confound outcome-engineered AI.
    
3. **Historical precedent for algebraic formalisation.**  Lacan’s mathemes and topological diagrams, opaque to clinicians, are surprisingly friendly to modern graph- and manifold-based ML pipelines — precisely the representational tools neuroscience now uses to compress whole-brain states.
    

  

Thus, importing psychoanalytic structure is not humanities tourism; it is a calculated wager that _motivational formalism_ can plug holes left by both neuron-level fidelity projects and token-level language modellers.

### **Thesis for the Remaining Paper**

  

Because both biological replication and task-mimic engineering have demonstrable, category-specific failings, **AI architecture must admit cross-disciplinary constraints.**  Psychoanalysis — and Lacan’s in particular — offers a rigorously theorised economy of desire, absence and symbolic mediation that maps cleanly onto computational notions of drive functions, error signals and context windows.  If our ambition is a machine that behaves _coherently human_, then a theory that formalises what coherence costs the human psyche is not a luxury; it is a missing design spec.

  

The pages that follow therefore justify how a properly formalised Lacanian topology can mutate from an esoteric clinical metaphor into an operational module inside a next-generation AI stack.

### Return to Lacanian Psychoanalytic Topology






The essential question raises in the demotic community is: when
 
We do not intend create a purely performant machine or build a better chatbot. Rather, we reconfigure what a machine subject could be. It is to ask: Can we model the drive? Can we simulate fantasy as a structuring loop around a constitutive absence? Can a machine speak not because it knows, but because it lacks — and in lacking, desires? If contemporary AI builds systems that "know," this project proposes a machine that "wants" — and in wanting, begins to be wanted, to repeat, to err, and perhaps, to become something like a subject.

At heart, lacanian subject is a _metaphysical_ claim: the subject is constituted through a gap introduced by language — not a neurological or behavioral deficit one can plug into an fMRI.  Any operationalization must replace “lack” with proxies (speech patterns, dopamine bursts, prediction errors).  remains a heuristic, rather than an empirically falsifiable hypothesis


As a result, his legacy remained largely marginal within the scientific community for much of the twentieth century, overshadowed by the ascendant influence of behaviorism, which privileged apparatus like the stimulus–response conditioning, observable behavior, and experimental replicability.

Within such a milieu, the Lacanian subject - the conscious, experiencing self is manifests a defined not by behavioral regularities but by a structure, with his attempt to describe this structure precisely. 

structural lack, desire, and the inscrutable logic of the unconscious—appeared irreconcilable with the epistemic norms of empirical psychology. Only in recent years, with the rise of computational models that can encode symbolic structure, nonlinearity, and self-referentiality, has Lacan’s work begun to find resonance beyond the confines of clinical psychoanalysis and critical theory.

A central locus of this critique sits on Lacan’s deployment of topology: knots, surfaces, and algebraic “mathemes” that seem to elevate psychoanalysis to mathematical rigors. Nevertheless, this topologisation nearly becomes a stigma of his theory. ill-conceived as an unnecessary layer of self-indulgent difficulty. Instead of clinical tools, these psycho-topological constructs feel more gesture than guidance. Many commentators point out that his turn from structural linguistics to his penchant for algebraic topology often produce a theory too abstract to apply consistently in a clinical setting. In many cases, Lacan never quite managed to extricate this interrogation: how is topology not just relevant, but a must? and how is this particular form of mental construct is not one of infinity many choice of presentation, but *the* one, that formulates the structure of the psychic.

the his *clinical* topology was introduced without grounding its relevance to psychic structures or analytic techniques, so its application remains both ambiguous and seemingly gratuitous.


err in basic mathematical terminology 

One might conjecture that Lacan turned to topology out of a desire for **structural precision**. From the late 1950s into the 1960s, Lacan grew increasingly convinced that the Freudian unconscious was “structured like a language,” and that its three registers (the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real) could best be modeled not by linear diagrams but by the continuous, non‐Euclidean surfaces of topology. As he famously put it, he began “to re-read Freud’s works in relation to contemporary philosophy, linguistics, ethnology, biology, and topology” in order to defend psychoanalysis’s scientific status and to capture the “double inscription” of conscious and unconscious processes in a single formal apparatus. He may intend to raise his theory to the dignity of the mathematics through a monolithic *pyscho - topology* framework, which gave Lacan the _formal tools_ to demolish surface-versus-depth clichés. The questions However, it remains unconvinced that it was strictly *necessary* to utilize such structure. His pursuit of rigor becomes more ill-founded in a context where the rigidity of topology reinforces the formalistic tendencies for which his theory has already been criticized. 

At this point, if we concede that his vision failed to unfold as successfully as he intended, the issue was not a lack of mathematical competence, but rather that it was insufficiently motivated—arguably in a misguided way. In a clinical setting, this gesture has been demonstrated impractical, undermining any claim to clarity or empirical utility; in a philosophical context, it remains heuristic at best, falling far short of Alain Badiou’s use of set theory, which at least transparently arises from the declared ontological commitment. 


The rigid, overly fixed lacanian subject may not be a drawback if posited in the 

His algebraic mathemes promise a symbolic precision akin to that found in mathematical discourse. Yet in practice, the complexity and allusiveness of these diagrams undermine any claim to clarity or empirical utility. The topological figures, instead of illuminating the dynamics of desire or subject formation, often obscure Lacan’s underlying theoretical commitments, rendering them inaccessible to readers without advanced mathematical training.

This opacity yields a profound methodological impasse in clinical applications. Consider Lacan’s notion of the *manque*—the fundamental lack that emerges within the symbolic order. While theoretically pivotal, Lacan offers no operational criteria for locating or measuring this gap during analysis. Consequently, practitioners can retroactively fit nearly any clinical observation to Lacan’s schema, a flexibility that undercuts the falsifiability and clinical motivation of the theory.

To transcend these limitations, we propose reframing Lacanian psychoanalysis not as a prescriptive clinical protocol but as a structural paradigm amenable to computational modeling. By analogizing the Lacanian subject to a complex system, we can repurpose topological constructs as formal components within a type architecture or context model. In this reframing, questions of where and how the *manque* manifests become engineering design decisions rather than metaphysical enigmas.

Formalizing Lacan’s mathemes as computational modules allows us to impose rigorous consistency constraints, detect “hallucinations” (i.e., violations of the symbolic rules), and log invariant properties amenable to unit testing. The once-mystical aura of Lacan’s diagrams dissipates when they are expressed in code: their validity can be assessed quantitatively, and their behavior observed under controlled simulation.

This computational reorientation is timely. Recent advances provide a robust foundation for operationalizing Lacanian topology: (i) formal mappings between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Lacanian structures have been established; (ii) topological data analysis (TDA) delivers concrete insights into high-dimensional neural data; and (iii) machine-learning pipelines are increasingly capable of optimizing over topological constraints. Peer-reviewed implementations already embed Lacanian orders within active-inference frameworks, audited by TDA tools, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

Accordingly, the present collection of notes pursues two interlinked objectives. First, it introduces key Lacanian concepts—especially those pertaining to the symbolic order and topological mathemes—to a readership unacquainted with his seminars. Second, it consolidates Lacan’s foundational attempts to integrate topology into psychoanalytic theory and reinterprets them as formal structures for computational modeling. Drawing primarily on Lacan’s late seminars and Will Greenshields’s *Writing the Structure of the Subject*, these notes lay the groundwork for a systematically computable model of the subject. The overarching question guiding this investigation is clear: how can Lacan’s challenging deployment of topology be rendered operationally viable for the design of artificial subjectivity?
