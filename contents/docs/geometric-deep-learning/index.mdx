# Geometric Deep Learning

## Procedure of Machine Learning

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant datasets
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms
4. **Training**: Fitting the model to data
5. **Evaluation**: Testing model performance
6. **Deployment**: Implementing the trained model
7. **Monitoring**: Ongoing performance assessment
